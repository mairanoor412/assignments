//Task1. Miles-to-Kilometers Converter (Operators):
// • Create a variable named miles and assign a numeric value representing distance in miles.
// • Calculate the equivalent distance in kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile =
// 1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
// • Store the converted distance in kilometers in a variable named kilometers.
// • Use console.log to print a message in the following format:
// The distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles
var miles = 130;
var kilometers = miles * 1.60934;
console.log("The distance of ".concat(miles, " miles is equal to ").concat(kilometers.toFixed(4), " kilometers. "));
